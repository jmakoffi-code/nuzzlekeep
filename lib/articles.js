      "Most dogs don't actually hate nail trims. They hate <em>bad</em> nail trims, the kind where someone's rushing, gripping too hard, or squinting at a dark nail with no idea where to stop. Get the grip and the light right and it's a five-minute job, no vet visit required.",
    whatYouNeed:
      "Dog-specific clippers (guillotine-style works well for small breeds, scissor-style for larger ones) or a grinder if your dog tolerates the noise. Keep styptic powder within reach even if you don't think you'll need it. And treats. Good treats, not the stale ones at the bottom of the bag.",

        title: "Find the quick before the clipper goes anywhere near the nail",
        body: "Light nails make this easy: look for the pink, then stay a couple of millimeters clear of it. Dark nails take patience. Trim in thin slices and stop the moment you see a dark dot appear in the center of the cut.",
      },

        title: "Angle the cut, don't go straight across",
